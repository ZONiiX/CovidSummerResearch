Our global operations expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continued to result in challenging operating environments. COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe to almost all of the countries and territories in which our products are developed, made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous measures to stall the spread and reduce the impact of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures, and have also implemented multi-step polices with the goal of re-opening these markets. These measures have impacted and continue to impact us, our employees, customers, contract manufacturers, distributors, partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. The countries and territories in which our products are developed, made, manufactured, distributed or sold are in varying stages of restrictions, re-opening and re-closing to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain jurisdictions have begun re-opening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. There is considerable uncertainty regarding how the effects of the pandemic, including current and future health and safety measures implemented in response to the pandemic, will impact our business, including whether they will result in further changes in demand for our products, further increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, operating costs or otherwise), further impact our ability to perform research and development, manufacturing, and shipping of our products, how they will further impact our supply chain and whether they will result in further reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, each or all of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. To date, we have incurred increased costs as a result of COVID-19, including increased expenses to implement additional measures to ensure the health and safety of our workforce, such as weekly COVID-19 testing. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our facilities may continue to impact the availability of our employees, some of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. If a significant percentage of our or our business partners’ workforce is unable to work, including because of illness, facility closures, quarantine, curfews, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions, social distancing requirements or other governmental restrictions or voluntarily adopted practices, our operations will be negatively impacted. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners’ operations, research and development, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials or other supplies as a result of these measures, restrictions or disruptions, including as a result of increased demand for certain products, can materially impair our ability to develop, make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. ', 'While we have taken steps to mitigate potential supply chain and transportation infrastructure system issues which may result from the COVID-19 pandemic, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate the risks described in this risk factor and could cause certain of our suppliers to be unable to operate temporarily or go out of business permanently. The realization of any of these risks could prevent us from producing, selling or delivering our products, reduce our sales and harm our gross margins or permanently cause a change in one or more of our products that may not be accepted by our customers or cause us to eliminate ', 'The risk of manufacturing defects or quality control issues is generally higher for new products, whether produced by us or a third-party manufacturer, products that are transitioned from one manufacturer to another, particularly if manufacturing is transitioned or initiated with a manufacturer we have not worked with in the past, and products that are transferred from one manufacturing facility to another. Our current product roadmap calls for the introduction of new instruments and consumables, which may require that we utilize manufacturers with which we have little or no prior manufacturing experience and the risk of manufacturing defects or quality control issues could increase as a result. The expansion of our manufacturing capabilities could increase the risk of manufacturing defects or quality control issues in the consumables we manufacture. We cannot assure investors that we and our third-party manufacturers will be able to launch new products on time, transition manufacturing of existing products to new manufacturers, transition our manufacturing capabilities to a new location or transition manufacturing of any additional consumables in-house without manufacturing defects. Additionally, impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, including impacts on the health and safety of our manufacturing staff or on the global supply chain and transportation infrastructure, may limit our ability to manufacture products and components that meet specifications, in necessary quantities and at commercially acceptable costs and deliver them in commercially acceptable timeframes to our customers.', 'With the implementation of our protocols and safety measures, our production, shipping and customer service functions have been operational and we have been able to maintain a continuous supply of products to our customers. We are communicating regularly with our suppliers, our supply chain remains intact and we have not yet experienced significant supply issues. With respect to equipment and raw material supply, we continue to work to secure sufficient critical equipment and raw materials to meet anticipated future demand and we are carrying higher levels of inventory and monitoring closely whether there will be a material negative impact due to potential future shortages or price increases from suppliers. Our customer service teams around the world are operating remotely and remain available to assist our customers and partners as needed;', ""During the first half of 2020, the vast majority of academic and government labs around the world suspended or severely reduced operations in compliance with stay-at-home, shelter-in-place and similar orders resulting in a decrease in overall demand during this period and also resulting in our production facilities running at less than normal capacity which negatively impacted our gross margins. While we experienced higher demand for our products during the second half of 2020 due to partial reopening of our customer's businesses, until and unless demand for our solutions normalizes, our gross profits and gross margins will be negatively impacted. While we cannot reliably estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our overall gross profit and gross margins in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond, we plan to continue to invest in our manufacturing facilities and production efforts and manage our supply chain to ensure the delivery of products to our customers."", ""The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, resulted in the closure of many of our customers’ facilities, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. While certain of our customers' labs began to re-open in June 2020 and continued to re-open during the second half of 2020, many of those labs are not yet fully operational and an extended period of economic disruption and closure, on-going limitations on operations at customer facilities or re-closure of our customers’ labs could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and access to sources of liquidity. We will continue to monitor the development and control of the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe there will be an increase in business activity upon the loosening of pandemic-related restrictions, including a resurgence in activity levels at laboratories which were temporarily closed, barring a renewed increase in COVID-19 cases which may lead to further business closures. Although we are currently uncertain as to when this resurgence will occur, we intend to invest in research and development activities and other initiatives while the COVID-19 pandemic is brought under control including accelerated investments in product development and intellectual property to launch new products and continue improving existing 10x solutions. Additionally, we plan to continue to build our commercial organization across key geographies around the world and invest in capabilities to address the interest we are seeing from the pharmaceutical and translational markets.

3M CO,02/04/2021,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66740/000155837021000737/mmm-20201231x10k.htm,"['In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets. Generally, as demand for certain COVID-related products surged, 3M saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets. Within the supply chain of less essential products, 3M experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations. Conversely, as markets re-opened and demand increased, the Company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year.', '3M, as a global company, is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. In addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted 3M’s operations. In these challenging and dynamic circumstances, 3M continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of approximately 50,000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted 3M’s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. Even with 3M’s accelerated production at its global facilities combined with capacity from other manufacturers, the industry-wide challenge is that global demand for N95 and other respirators continues to exceed the industries’ ability to deliver. Within individual regions and countries around the world, 3M is working with governments, distributors and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs. 3M’s manufacturing, supply chain and distribution protocols have, for example, been impacted by the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act. In addition, trade barriers, export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection equipment including those made by 3M going into the most needed areas. COVID-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3M. Some of these COVID-related factors have increased demand for certain 3M products, while others have decreased demand from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. 3M has received reports of price gouging, counterfeiting and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving its N95 respirators, has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state, federal and international law enforcement to protect the public and 3M against those who seek to exploit 3M’s brand and reputation and defraud others. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. For example, COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital. As economies start to reopen in certain parts of the world, workplace safety, for the Company and others, will increasingly become a focus of concern. As part of the return to work process at the Company, the Company could face additional privacy and data security risks related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors with respect to COVID-19 testing, temperature checks, and contact tracing. Due to the speed and scope with which the COVID situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.', 'Public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted 3M’s operations. 3M continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of people who work in its plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted 3M’s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. As this situation continues, 3M also closely monitors and responds to potential impacts to the Company’s broader supply chain associated with other products. COVID-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3M. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth.The Company has taken steps to help employees lead safe and productive lives during the outbreak including remote working; escalated procedures in factories related to personal safety, cleaning and medical screening measures; and pandemic leave policies. 3M closely monitors how the spread of COVID-19 is affecting employees and business operations and has preparedness plans to help protect the safety of employees around the world while safely continuing business. While nearly all of our manufacturing locations and distribution centers are fully or partially operational, the Company ', 'Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M’s consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains as described above. While it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on 3M’s results of operations, below are factors that 3M believes have also affected its 2020 results:', 'In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets.

Although we have continued to operate our facilities to date consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, the outbreak of COVID-19 and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may have a material adverse effect on our operations, supply chain, customers, and transportation networks, including business shutdowns or disruptions. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Any resulting financial impact cannot be estimated reasonably at this time, but may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession or depression. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of COVID-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which may adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Annual Report, such as those relating to our products and financial performance.', 'The magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 remains unpredictable and we, therefore, continue to anticipate potential supply chain disruptions, increased employee absenteeism and additional health and safety costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic that could unfavorably impact our business.']"

In addition, we offer a wide product selection, free prompt delivery, product setup, service and returns, and the ability to pause, cancel or resume lease contracts at any time with no additional costs to the customer.

Substantially all the items Woodhaven produces continue to be leased or sold through our stores, including franchised stores. However, we also manufacture and sell furniture products to other retailers.', 'Some of the products manufactured by Woodhaven Furniture Industries, our manufacturing division, may contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and/or gold.

Aaron\'s has been classified as a provider of essential products in most jurisdictions, and thus, its store showrooms generally were not required to close. Despite such exemption, beginning in mid-March 2020, we largely shifted to e-commerce and curbside service for our company-operated stores to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates, except where such curbside service was prohibited by governmental authorities. While we have since reopened nearly all of our store showrooms, there can be no assurances that these operations will continue to remain open if, for example, there are localized increases or additional ""waves"" in the number of COVID-19 cases and, in response, governmental authorities issue orders requiring such closures or limitations on operations, or we voluntarily close our showrooms temporarily or otherwise limit their operations to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates, as we have done, for example, where we learn that an employee or customer who was in a store location has subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. Such governmental requirements or voluntary action could adversely impact future financial performance. Additionally, we have experienced disruptions in our supply chain which have impacted product availability in some of our stores and, in some situations, required us to procure inventory from alternative sources at higher costs.', 'supply chain delays and disruptions due to closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas, or other pandemic-related risk mitigation limitations and restrictions; and', 'We face many challenges which could materially and adversely affect our overall results of operations, including the commoditization of certain product categories, increasing competition from a growing variety of sources, a decentralized, high-fixed-cost operating model, adverse consequences to our supply chain function from decreased procurement volumes and from the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing costs for labor and transportation, and lower lease volumes, and thus, less recurring revenues written into our customer lease portfolio.', 'In addition, our supply chain function and financial performance may suffer adverse consequences related to the decreases we have experienced, and may continue to experience, in the volume of merchandise we purchase from third party suppliers, due to, among other factors, our store closures, declining sales of merchandise to franchisees, and lower lease volumes. Those consequences may include, for example, smaller discounts from our vendors, or the elimination of discount programs previously offered to us, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Declining merchandise purchase volumes have caused us to rationalize and consolidate, and may result in us further rationalizing and consolidating, vendors for certain product categories, and we may not effectively implement those vendor consolidation initiatives, which could lead to disruptions to our supply chain, including delivery delays or unavailability of certain types of merchandise for our stores and our franchisees’ stores.', 'We have experienced and may continue to experience increases in the costs we incur to purchase certain merchandise that we offer for sale or lease to our customers, due to tariffs, increases in prices for certain commodities, COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, and increases in the costs of shipping the merchandise to our distribution centers and store locations. We have limited or no control over many of these inflationary forces on our costs. In addition, we may not be able to recover all or even a portion of such cost increases by increasing our merchandise prices, fees, or otherwise, and even if we are able to increase merchandise prices or fees, those cost increases to our customers could result in the customers curtailing entering into sales and lease ownership agreements for the types of merchandise we offer, or entering into agreements that generate less revenue for us, resulting in lower same store revenues, revenues and profits.', 'On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic.

Since that time, we have reopened nearly all of our store showrooms, but there can be no assurance that those showrooms will not be closed in future months, or have their operations limited, if, for example, there are localized increases or ""additional waves"" in the number of COVID-19 cases in the areas where our stores are located and, in response, governmental authorities issue orders requiring such closures or limitations on operations, or we voluntarily close our showrooms or limit their operations to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates. Furthermore, we are experiencing disruptions in our supply chain which have impacted product availability in some of our stores and, in some situations, we are procuring inventory from alternative sources at higher costs.

The extent of any such impacts likely would depend on several factors, including (a) the length and severity of the pandemic, including, for example, localized outbreaks or additional waves of outbreaks of COVID-19 cases; (b) the impact of any such outbreaks on our customers, suppliers, and employees; (c) the nature of any government orders issued in response to such outbreaks, including whether we would be deemed essential, and thus, exempt from all or some portion of such orders; (d) whether there is one or more additional rounds of government stimulus and/or enhanced unemployment benefits in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the nature, timing and amount of any such stimulus payments or benefits; and (e) supply chain disruptions for our business.', 'In March 2020, the Company voluntarily closed the showrooms for all of its company-operated stores, and moved to an e-commerce and curbside only service model to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates, while continuing to provide our customers with the essential products they needed such as refrigerators, freezers, mattresses and computers. Since that time, we have reopened nearly all of our store showrooms. There can be no assurances that some portion or all of those showrooms will not be closed in the future, whether due to COVID-19 pandemic-related government orders or voluntarily by us where we determine that such closures are necessary to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such closures or restrictions may have an unfavorable impact on the revenues and earnings in future periods, and could also have an unfavorable impact on the Company’s liquidity, as discussed below in the ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" section. Although almost all of the showrooms of company-operated stores had reopened by the end of the second quarter of 2020, changing consumer behavior, such as consumers voluntarily refraining from shopping in-person at those store locations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing supply chain disruptions, particularly in appliance, furniture, and electronics, are expected to continue to challenge new lease originations in future periods.', 'Lease merchandise decreased $84.4\xa0million due to (a) lower lease merchandise purchases as a result of store closures and related initiatives; (b) ongoing supply chain disruptions, particularly in appliance, furniture and electronics, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; and (c) an increase in customer early buyouts, which were higher than historical levels through 2020, which we believe was due primarily to the impact of government stimulus measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.']"

We maintain substantial inventories of raw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. We also maintain substantial finished goods inventories. Our practice of maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess and/or obsolete. This excess and obsolete inventory may require us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.', 'In the industry in which we compete, sales and approval cycles are often lengthy. Selling efforts often involve a significant commitment of time and resources by us and our customers that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, or region-specific product certification and homologation requirements for deployment in networks. Additionally, a supplier must first obtain product approval from a major or other service provider to sell its products to these service providers. This process can last from six to eighteen months, or longer, depending on the technology, the service provider and the demand for the product from the service provider’s subscribers. Consequently, we are involved in a constant process of submitting for approval succeeding generations of products, as well as products that deploy new technology or respond to new technology demands from a major or other service provider. We have been successful in the past in obtaining these approvals; however, we cannot be certain that we will obtain these approvals in the future or that sales of these products will continue to occur. Any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers, or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the production of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the delay in sales until the completion of the approval process, the length of which is difficult to predict, could result in fluctuations of revenue and uneven operating results from quarter to quarter or year to year. Further, once customer approval or certifications are met, our supply chain customers typically do not guarantee us a minimum, or any, volume of sales. We are dependent on individual purchase orders as discussed elsewhere in this report.', 'Certain raw materials and key components used in our products are currently available from only one source, and others are available from only a limited number of sources. The availability of these raw materials and supplies may be subject to market forces beyond our control, such as merger and acquisition activity of our suppliers and consolidation in some segments of our supplier base. From time to time, there may not be sufficient quantities of raw materials and supplies in the marketplace to meet customer demand. Many companies utilize the same raw materials and supplies that we do in the production of their products. Companies with more resources than our own may have a competitive advantage in obtaining raw materials and supplies due to greater buying power. These factors can result in reduced supply, higher prices of raw materials and delays in the receipt of certain of our key components, which in turn may generate increased costs, lower margins and delays in product delivery, with a corresponding adverse effect on revenues and customer relationships. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to obviate the necessity of certain components and by building long-term relationships and close contact with each of our key suppliers; however, we cannot assure that delays in or failures of deliveries of key components, either to us or to our contract manufacturers, and consequent delays in product deliveries, will not occur in the future.

We have experienced some impact to our supply chain, including a slowdown in supply chain deliveries, extended lead times on some key components and some raw material cost increases. We have also had to increase our volume of inventory to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic. In addition, we have experienced significant increases in freight-related costs. While throughout the pandemic, we have seen increased demand in networking requirements and utilization due to social distancing guidelines issued by governments, as well as COVID-19 related reductions in travel and infrastructure expenses, it is possible that we could experience some slowdown in demand and further supply chain issues as the pandemic continues. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.', 'The increase in inventory was due to increased purchases in preparation for new product ramp ups as well as strategic inventory buffer purchases to ensure supply continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the quarter and the\xa0year progress, such demand can change rapidly or we may realize that our customers’ expectations were overly optimistic or pessimistic, especially when industry or general economic conditions change. Orders with our suppliers cannot always be amended in response. In addition, to assure availability of certain components or to obtain priority pricing, we have entered into contracts with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase a specified number of components and subassemblies each quarter, even if we are not able to use such components or subassemblies. Moreover, we have obligations to some of our customers to hold a minimum amount of finished goods in inventory, to fulfill just in time orders, regardless of whether the customers expect to place such orders.

As a global provider of products that are key inputs for our customers’ processes serving a variety of end-markets, a pandemic presents obstacles that can adversely affect our supply chain effectiveness and efficiencies, our manufacturing operations and customer demand for our products and, ultimately, our financial results. We believe we are positioned to respond to and mitigate the potential impacts of rapidly evolving market dynamics. While the Company was not materially impacted by COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020, the Company experienced lower demand, particularly in nylon, caprolactam and phenol, during the second quarter of 2020, resulting in a reduction of utilization rates and a decrease in overall sales volume compared to the prior year period, primarily related to global markets and the economic impact of COVID-19. During the second half of 2020, the Company experienced an improvement of demand to approximately pre-COVID-19 levels; however, there is no assurance that sales volumes will remain stable or that demand will fully recover or continue given the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and abroad, increases in restrictions imposed by governments, or other factors resulting from sustained, or further resurgences in, infection rates.

If we experience transportation problems, or if there are other significant changes in the cost of these services, we may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship products to our customers. We also seek to maintain appropriate buffer inventory of intermediate chemicals necessary for our manufacturing process, which are intended to mitigate the extent of any delays or disruptions in supply chain logistics. However, our failure to obtain raw materials, ship products or maintain sufficient buffer inventory could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.', 'Additionally, there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature, stringency and timing of any future regulations or changes in regulations, including discharges into the air and water, handling and disposal of hazardous wastes, remediation of soil and groundwater, and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) and water nutrient regulations. Due to the concerns about risks associated with air, water, global warming and climate change, more stringent regulations, including those which could result from the recent change in the U.S. presidential administration, may require us to incur additional capital expenditures or make changes to our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency, limit our output, increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy, raw materials or transportation or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If enacted, more stringent GHG limitations are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facilities emit GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our production process. To the extent that GHG or other restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the United States, our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us. In addition, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Consequently, legislative and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHG could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.', 'Further, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more extreme weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operating activities, disrupt our maritime logistics and intraplant supply chain, increase our costs of operations or reduce the efficiency of our operations, and potentially increase costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such conditions. Long-term, higher average global temperatures could result in changes in natural resources, growing seasons, precipitation patterns, weather patterns, species distributions, water availability, sea levels, and biodiversity. These impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain our production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs in the future. We continually assess our manufacturing plants for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change. We are continuing to evaluate sea level rise and storm surge at our plants to understand potential impacts and response actions that may need to be taken. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship.', 'We also manufacture, market and sell a number of chemical intermediate products that are derived from the chemical processes within our integrated supply chain. Most significant is acetone, which is used by our customers in the production of adhesives, paints, coatings and solvents. Prices for acetone are influenced by its own supply and demand dynamics but can also be influenced by the underlying move in propylene input costs. We continue to invest in and grow our differentiated product offerings in high-purity applications and high-value intermediates including our oximes-based EZ-Blox™ anti-skinning agent used in paints and Nadone® cyclohexanone, which is a solvent used in various high-value applications.', 'We seek to run our production facilities on a nearly continuous basis for maximum efficiency as several of our intermediate products are key feedstock materials for other products in our integrated manufacturing chain. While our integration, scale and range of product offerings make us one of the most efficient manufacturers in our industry, these attributes also expose us to increased risk associated with material disruptions at any one of our production facilities or logistics operations which could impact the overall manufacturing supply chain. Further, although we believe that our sources of supply for our raw materials, including cumene, natural gas and sulfur, are generally robust, it is difficult to predict the impact that shortages, increased costs and related supply chain logistics considerations may have in the future. In order to mitigate the risk of unplanned interruptions, we schedule several planned plant turnarounds each year to conduct routine and major maintenance across our facilities. We also utilize maintenance excellence and mechanical integrity programs, targeted buffer inventory of intermediate chemicals necessary for our manufacturing process, and co-producer swap arrangements, which are intended to mitigate the extent of any production losses as a result of planned and unplanned downtime; however, the mitigation of all or part of any such production impact cannot be assured.

As a global provider of products that are key inputs for our customers’ processes serving a variety of end-markets, a pandemic presents obstacles that can adversely affect our supply chain effectiveness and efficiencies, our manufacturing operations and customer demand for our products and, ultimately, our financial results.

From an industry perspective, building and construction demand has improved, particularly in residential applications, however, commercial construction remains soft. Auto demand has also been improving with the U.S. and Europe experiencing a slower recovery, while China and other Asia markets saw a faster rebound. Export demand for textiles out of Asia has been soft, which has had an impact on nylon supply and demand conditions. The nylon product line has seen an improvement in demand domestically as end markets improved from a challenging first half of 2020. Ammonium Sulfate and acetone demand have not been significantly impacted by COVID-19 to date. Ammonium Sulfate has experienced steady demand through the peak second quarter domestic planting season and into the new season fill, while the North American acetone industry supply and demand balance has continued to be favorable following the affirmative final anti-dumping duties and robust demand for isopropyl alcohol (IPA), used for hand sanitizer and other disinfectants, and methyl methacrylate (MMA), used for acrylic screens, and other solvents.

The PES disruption did not have a material impact on second quarter 2019 financial results. The Company incurred an approximately $10 million unfavorable impact to pre-tax income in the second half of 2019, including incremental raw material and logistics costs as well as a modest unfavorable impact from fixed cost absorption. As the PES refinery remains shutdown, the Company submitted a business interruption insurance claim and has realigned its supply chain to ensure the continuity of cumene supply.

While the facility in Vietnam is an affiliate of the existing manufacturer in China and meets the required qualifications, we may experience delays or quality issues as we begin to ramp up the new facility.\xa0Additionally, any or all of the following could either limit supply or increase costs, directly or indirectly, to us or our contract manufacturers: ', 'There have been significant changes and proposed changes to United States trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China. For example, the United States has imposed supplemental tariffs of up to 25% on certain imports from China, as well as tariffs on steel and aluminum products imported from various other countries. In response, China and other countries have imposed or proposed additional tariffs on certain exports from the United States. Although we do a significant amount of business in China, including dealing with Chinese suppliers and customers, for the products that use imported components that are covered under these policies, our import of components for manufacture of products in the U.S is subject to relatively lower tariff rates and therefore we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on us. Additionally, in 2020 we contracted with a new contract manufacturer outside of China, which gives us additional supply chain diversity as well as an option of supply of components and assemblies for our products that can be imported to the United States without the supplemental tariff. However, these and other proposed policy changes have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China, as well as other countries, including with respect to the trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade with those countries. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these countries and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy in China and elsewhere around the world. ', 'The continued spread of COVID-19 and its related effects on our business have had a material and adverse effect on our business operations. Through the date of this filing, these disruptions or restrictions include restrictions on our ability to travel, temporary closures of our office buildings or the facilities of our customers or suppliers, and during the fourth quarter, disruptions with certain components in our supply chain located in Asia. Such disruptions of our customers have had a negative impact on our sales and operating results, particularly in the first quarter. Related to sales, we saw orders begin to rebound in the second and third quarters. However, the continued spread of COVID-19 may adversely affect such rebound and have a negative effect on our operating results in future quarters. ', '. Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility-related costs attributable to our engineering research and development personnel. These expenses include work related to the design, engineering and testing of antenna designs, and antenna integration, validation and testing of customer devices. These expenses include salaries, including stock-based compensation, benefits, bonuses, travel, communications, and similar costs, and depreciation and allocated operating expenses such as office supplies, premises expenses and insurance. We may also incur expenses from consultants and for prototyping new antenna solutions. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in the development of new solutions and markets and as we invest in improving efficiencies within our supply chain, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total sales.

While some jurisdictions, including some in the Southern Company system\'s service territory, have relaxed some of these restrictions, many of these restrictions remain and there is no guarantee restrictions will not be reimposed in the future. These restrictions have significantly disrupted economic activity in the service territories of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities and caused volatility in capital markets at certain periods during 2020. For example, retail electric revenues have declined slightly compared to 2019, as discussed further in RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – ""Southern Company – Electricity Business"" in Item 7 herein. In addition, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities temporarily suspended disconnections for non-payment by customers and waived late fees for certain periods. The effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, further reduced labor availability and productivity, and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Registrants, including, but not limited to, continued reduced demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, reductions in investments recorded at fair value, and further impairment of the ability of the Registrants to develop, construct, and operate facilities, including electric generation, transmission, and distribution assets, to perform necessary corporate and customer service functions, and to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets.

We have a cash repatriation strategy that targets a certain amount of foreign current year earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. While, to date, we have been able to make such repatriations without substantial governmental restrictions, changes in the trade or regulatory compliance in any country that we have significant cash balances could make it more difficult to repatriate foreign earnings cost-effectively in the future.', 'In the MC segment, the Chinese New Year, summer months, and the end of the year are often periods of lower production for some of our customers, which, in the past contributed to seasonal variation in sales and orders.

The impact of these combined factors on any quarter can be difficult to predict, and can make quarterly comparisons less meaningful than annual comparisons. While seasonality is generally not a significant factor in the Albany Engineered Composites segment, the commercial terms of the supply agreement governing the LEAP program resulted in fourth quarter sales volatility in recent years.', '• Disruptions in supply chains may place constraints on our ability to source key raw materials and services which could impact our ability to deliver products to customers as scheduled.

Additionally, many of AEC’s customers, as well as the companies supplied by our customers are under pressure to achieve acceptable returns on their substantial investments in recent years in new technologies, new programs and new product introductions. This has contributed to a relentless focus on reducing costs, resulting in continuous pressure for cost reduction and pricing improvement throughout the supply chain. The recent wave of consolidation in the aerospace industry could continue or intensify these pressures.', 'There are a limited number of suppliers of polymer fiber and monofilaments, key raw materials used in the manufacture of machine clothing, and of carbon fiber and carbon resin, key raw materials used by AEC. In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of some of the equipment used in each of the MC and AEC segments. The risks associated with limited suppliers were increased during 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on the supply chain, as well as transportation companies that deliver our products to customers. While we have always been able to meet our raw material and equipment needs, the limited number of suppliers of these items creates the potential for disruptions in supply. AEC currently relies on single suppliers under contracts they have with SAFRAN to meet the carbon fiber and carbon resin requirements for the LEAP program.

As part of the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, federal, state and local governments have imposed various restrictions on the conduct of business and travel, such as stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and quarantines. These measures, as well as changes in employee health and safety concerns and consumer spending patterns, trends and preferences, have led to widespread business closures and lower demand for our products, with the most pronounced negative impacts of these measures on our results of operations occurring during the second quarter of 2020. Further, changes in commercial real estate occupancy, constraints on government and institutional budgets and the uncertain business climate have led to declines and delays in new construction activity and discretionary projects, including in many of the commercial and institutional construction markets we serve.

Since first reported in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, including millions of confirmed cases, business slowdowns or shutdowns, government challenges, and market volatility of an unprecedented nature. Although we have, to date, managed to continue most of our operations, we cannot predict the future course of events nor can we assure that this global pandemic, including its economic impact, will not continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty and turmoil in the coal and oil & gas industries. The COVID-19 outbreak and the responsive actions to limit the spread of the virus have significantly reduced global economic activity, resulting in a decline in the demand for coal, oil, natural gas and other commodities, and negatively impacted our results of operations for 2020. Our operations could be further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, or absenteeism; steps the company has taken to protect health and well-being; government actions; facility closures; work slowdowns or stoppages; inadequate supplies or resources (such as reliable personal protective equipment, testing, and vaccines); or other circumstances related to COVID-19. Looking forward, we could be unable to perform fully on our contracts, we could experience interruptions in our business and we could incur liabilities and suffer losses as a result. We will continue to incur additional costs because of the COVID-19 outbreak, including protecting the health and well-being of our employees and as a result of impacts on operations and performance, which costs we may not be fully able to recover. We could be subject to additional regulatory requirements, enforcement actions, and litigation, again with costs and liabilities that are not fully recoverable or insured. The continued spread of COVID-19 could also affect our ability to hire, develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce, and to maintain our corporate culture. The continued global pandemic, including the economic impact, is likely also to cause further disruption in our supply chain. If our suppliers have increased challenges with their workforce (including as a result of illness, absenteeism or government orders), facility closures, access to necessary components and supplies, access to capital, and access to fundamental support services (such as shipping and transportation), they could be unable to provide the agreed-upon goods and services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner.

However, it is unclear how these climate change concerns will ultimately impact us.  We could incur costs or other obligations to comply with future GHG regulations, and could become the target of legal claims or challenges, because generating electricity using fossil fuels emits CO2 and other GHG.  Further, investors may determine that we are too reliant on fossil fuels, reducing demand for our stock, which may cause our stock price to decrease, or not buy our debt securities, which may cause our cost of capital to increase.  We could face additional pressures from customers, investors or other stakeholders to more rapidly reduce CO2 emissions on a voluntary-basis, including faster adoption of lower CO2 emitting technologies and management of excess renewable energy credits.  The timing and pace to fully achieve decarbonization is also contingent on the future development of technologies to reliably store and manage electricity, as well as electrification of other economic sectors.  The EPA’s approach and timing for implementing rules to regulate CO2 emissions at fossil-fuel fired electric generating units remains undecided and subject to litigation and could change based on the new Presidential Administration.  Various legislative and regulatory proposals to address climate change at the national, state and local levels continue to be introduced.  Regulation or legislation mandating CO2 emissions reductions or other clean energy standards could materially increase costs, causing some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain.  We are vulnerable to potential risks associated with transition to a lower-carbon economy that may extend to our supply chain and natural gas operations.

These contaminations could also increase the risk of adverse side effects. Furthermore, our allogeneic products ultimately consist of many individual cell lines, each with a different HLA profile. As a result, the selection and distribution of the appropriate cell line for therapeutic use in a patient requires close coordination between clinical operations, supply chain and quality assurance personnel. ', 'Maintaining clinical and commercial timelines is dependent on our end-to-end supply chain network to support manufacturing; if we experience problems with our third party suppliers, the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed. ', 'The development of our product candidates could be disrupted and materially adversely affected in the future by a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the global economy and has impacted our operations, including the interruption of our preclinical and clinical trial activities and potential interruption to our supply chain. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed clinical trials. If the disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues, our planned pivotal clinical trials also could be delayed due to government orders and site policies on account of the pandemic, and some patients may be unwilling or unable to travel to study sites, enroll in our trials or be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, which would delay our ability to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials or release clinical trial results and could delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, COVID-19 could affect our employees or the employees of research sites and service providers on whom we rely, including contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as those of companies with which we do business, including our suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, thereby disrupting our business operations. Quarantines and travel restrictions imposed by governments in the jurisdictions in which we and the companies with which we do business operate could materially impact the ability of employees to access preclinical and clinical sites, laboratories, manufacturing sites and offices. We have implemented work-at-home policies and only employees essential to the development and research of our product candidates remain on-site at our research and manufacturing facilities; accordingly, we may experience limitations in employee resources. The outbreak and any other preventative or protective actions that we, our suppliers or other third parties with which we have business relationships, or governments may take in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business.

We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the global pandemic and spread of COVID-19 and plan to continue taking steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a global work from home policy for all employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential business travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19 and variants thereof. Where and to the extent permitted to be open under local regulations, our office sites are operational with physical distancing, temperature screening, contact tracing and cleaning measures in place, as well as voluntary testing protocols in our Massachusetts facilities. At this time, we cannot predict when certain restrictions that are in place to protect our employees can be safely reduced or will no longer be needed, and such restrictions are likely to remain in place until there is widespread availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Due to the speed and fluidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the emergence of highly contagious variants, we do not yet know the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on our business operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the availability and efficacy of vaccines, among others. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility and continue to monitor developments as we deal with the disruptions and uncertainties from a business and financial perspective relating to COVID-19 and variants thereof. We will continue to work diligently with our partners and stakeholders to support patient access to our approved medicines, advance our product candidates under regulatory review as well as in our clinical studies to the extent safe to do so for patients, caregivers and healthcare practitioners, and ensure the continuity of our manufacturing and supply chain.
